                        <strong>Subhash Chandra Bose</strong>, in full (born
                        January 23, 1897,  Cuttack, Orissa [now Odisha], India—died August 18, 1945,  Taipei, Taiwan),
                        Indian revolutionary prominent in the independence movement against British rule of India.
                        He also led an Indian national force from abroad against the Western powers during World War II. 
                        He was a contemporary of Mohandas K. Gandhi, at times an ally and at other times an adversary. 
                        Bose was known in particular for his militant approach to independence and for his push for socialist policies.

                        Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education,
                        he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking 
                        the routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921 to join the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the 
                        Indian National Congress, Bose followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more
                        open to socialism. He became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, 
                        over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable 
                        attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.After a large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in
                        protest, Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.
